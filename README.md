# About me

Hi ! I'm Lucaseeyou2, a front-end programmer working with web technologies such as **HTML**, **CSS** and **Javascript**. I work on really silly projects that can be found under my repostories. These range from styles, to machines and other inventions that I imagined. Personally, I do enjoy creating and designing these websites and applications. I also enjoy :

* Listening to Music
* Working with computers
* Playing video games
